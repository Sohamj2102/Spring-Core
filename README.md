## 📌 Project Description

-This is a simple Order Management System developed using **Spring Framework (Core Module)** with **XML-based Setter Injection**.
-The goal of this project is to understand and implement the concept of **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** using XML configuration.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Spring IoC Container(FileSystemXmlApplicationContext)
- Setter-based Dependency Injection
- XML Bean Configuration (`applicationContext.xml`)
- Bean creation and lifecycle
- Modular code structure (model, service, config, main)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17)
- Spring Core
- Eclipse IDE
- Git & GitHub

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to create and configure Spring beans using XML
- Structure of a basic Spring project
- Using `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext` for loading context
- Hands-on with bean wiring (`<bean>`, `<property>`, `name`, `ref`, `value`)
